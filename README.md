## **Access**

The files for this module 6 assignment is uploaded to GitHub. Link to this GitHub repository will be shared.

---

## **Installation**

To be able to read, use and run the files, you need to have installed on your computer both keras and tensorflow for python and R.

To access the Github repository, go to the URL https://github.com/Kinta264/BAN6420-Module-6-Assignment

## **Usage**

Python
You are recommended to open the python files first.

The assignment has requested to work on CNN classification using fashion MNIST.

First, we import the required packages and libraries for the work.

We were requested to create layers of classification and then to provide prediction example.

You can run the code at each step to see the progression of the answer to assignment.
Upon completion of python code review, you can open the R file.

R
First, we import the required packages and libraries for the work.

Same as for python, we were requested to create layers of classification and then to provide prediction example.

You can run the code at each step to see the progression of the answer to assignment.

I had issues with installation of tensorflow in R, apologies if this reflects in the quality of work for this submission.
